Besley* is an original font created by indestructible type*. It is inspired by 
the designs of Robert Besley. This is version 1.1.

Besley* is designed and maintained by [Owen Earl](https://plus.google.com/103790404905174393616), who is the creator of the font foundry [indestructible type*](http://indestructible-type.github.io).

About
-----
The design process of Besley* started with looking at what works with 
Clarendon and maintaining those assets, while expanding design and 
functionality. In order to maintain a sturdy and heavy weighting, while adding 
text-size readability, wide capitals are used alongside appropriately widthed 
lowercase letters. To make Besley* render well on screens, a larger x-height 
was chosen. The medium weight of Besley* is bolder than typical fonts of the 
digital era, to give that cowboy era weight. Italics were built into the 
design process, so they feel like part of the family, instead of an 
after-thought.

Building
--------
I use fontmake to build the finished font files. If for some reason you want to build this font yourself, follow these steps:

Download the complete source code, either by cloning this repository or downloading the .zip file.

Download and install fontmake which can be found [here](https://github.com/googlei18n/fontmake).

Build your preferred version of the font by running the corresponding build file found in the "scripts" folder. For example running  `build-variable.sh` will build the variable version of the font. To toggle between the standard naming conventions and the indestructible type* naming conventions run the `toggle.sh` script found in the "misc" folder.
