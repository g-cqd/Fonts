# Techna Sans

Techna Sans is a bold, semi-geometric sans-serif typeface.
With its low contrast and sharp stroke endings,
it has an authentic and modern look, making it perfect for branding and headlines.
The typeface works well both in large and small sizes and handles tight spacing nicely.
Licensed under the SIL Open Font License,
Techna Sans is free both for personal and commercial use.

## OpenType features

### Single-storey a

An alternate, single-storey **a** is available via Stylistic Set 1.
If you are using CSS, the stylistic set can enabled with `font-feature-settings: 'ss01'`.
For other applications, e.g. Adobe InDesign, a quick Google search might be needed.

### Tabular figures

By default the typeface uses proportional figures,
but there is also a set of tabular figures available.
Tabular figures makes each number take up the same space,
which helps when setting tabular data.
The tabular figures can be enabled in CSS with `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`.
